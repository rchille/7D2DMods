List of Modlets
================================

Electric Stove:
Adds a working Electric Stove (one that needs to be attached to your power grid 
to cooks things) the functions like a camp fire. 
It adds the recipes to to craft one from scratch, as well as a repair kit that
allows you to upgrade a existing POIs stove into working version.
To craft either the Eletric Stove, or the Electric Stove Repair Kit, you will 
need to find a Electric Stove Schematic (whereever you would find common books)

Expensive Arrows and Bolts:
I've always thought that simple plant fiber had been under appreciated in 7D2D.
This Modlet fixes that a bit by requiring plant fiber to make arrows and bolts. 
Ever tried to make an arrow without a little twine to attach the arrowhead? 
Yeah.
Didn't think so.
