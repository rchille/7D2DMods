## List of Modlets

* Archer's Armory
* Electric Stove 


### Archers Armory
This Modlet features several tweaks and additions to recipes to make Bow Lover's 
experience a little more varied.
First, it makes basic stone/iron/steel arrows and bolts more expensive by 
requiring plant fiber (to attach the heads and fletching). 
Second, for cases when you really have to fill your quiver quicky, it adds a \
set of "bulk create" recipes that make 50 bolts or arrows at a time for all 
types.
Last, there are set of conversion recipes that allow you to change a bolt to 
an arrow or vice versa at the cost of 1 wood (basically to replace the shaft).
There are plans to add more arrow/bolt types in the future so stay tuned!
 

### Electric Stove [In Progress]
Adds a working Electric Stove (one that needs to be attached to your power grid 
to cooks things) the functions like a camp fire. 
It adds the recipes to to craft one from scratch, as well as a repair kit that
allows you to upgrade a existing POIs stove into working version.
To craft either the Eletric Stove, or the Electric Stove Repair Kit, you will 
need to find a Electric Stove Schematic (whereever you would find common books)
