================================

Electric Stove:
Adds a working Electric Stove (one that needs to be attached to your power grid 
to cooks things) the functions like a camp fire. 
It adds the recipes to to craft one from scratch, as well as a repair kit that
allows you to upgrade a existing POIs stove into working version.
To craft either the Eletric Stove, or the Electric Stove Repair Kit, you will 
need to find a Electric Stove Schematic (whereever you would find common books)
